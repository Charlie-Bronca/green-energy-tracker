# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point, you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However, we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

### Project Description

Green Energy Tracker is a website that helps users gain insights into energy sources across different regions of Great Britain, enabling them to make informed decisions regarding energy consumption and environmental impact. It utilizes Chart.js and the Carbon Intensity API to display real-time carbon intensity data. Upon loading the web page, users are greeted with an intuitive interface displaying pie charts showcasing carbon intensity levels for various regions such as England, Scotland, and Wales. These charts dynamically update in real-time as new data is fetched from the Carbon Intensity API, providing users with up-to-date information on energy usage patterns across the UK.

To access personalized insights, users can enter their postcode into the search bar. This feature allows users to quickly retrieve detailed information about energy consumption patterns and carbon intensity levels in their specific area. By leveraging Chart.js to render colorful pie charts directly within the browser, Green Energy Tracker empowers users to interpret complex data sets through graphical representations, facilitating greater awareness and engagement in sustainable energy practices. By using this website, users can drive meaningful changes in energy consumption habits and contribute to a more sustainable future.

In addition to providing insights into regional energy consumption and carbon intensity levels, Green Energy Tracker features a progress bar that tracks the UK's progress towards the ‘net-zero emissions by 2050’ goal. This progress bar serves as a visual representation of the nation's efforts to reduce carbon emissions and transition to renewable energy sources. By highlighting the UK's progress towards this target, the web application encourages users to stay informed and engaged in the collective effort to combat climate change.
